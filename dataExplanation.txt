Step 1: The training dataset consists of 1,01,180 training sample consist of 22 features set.Each sample
represent a person and features corresponding to him/her.

Step 2: The response variable is 'C' having values 0(for not buying the product)or 1(for buying the product).

Step 3: One of the major issues that we fall into when dealing with unbalanced datasets relates to the metrics used to evaluate their model.I import scale function from sklearn.preprocessing to standardize the data.

Step 4: I have dropped the unrequired columns using for eg(date,longitude,latitude columns).I could have Changed the Date column into Ordinal Value but I've dropped it.

Step 5: I have used the data.describe() function to remove the outliers as they were having variations. 

Step 6: To check the co-relation between predictors and response variable i have used spearman method .

Step 7: For Model Building I used first Logistic Regression but it wasnt giving me the Desired Result and then I used XGBOOST which boosted my Weak learner into A strong learner and yielded me 87.7% and Cohen Kappa around
75%.

Step 8:At the End I used Pickle to save my model and then Used that model on my Test Data.

Step 9:I took the output of the prediction and then combined with Index as Ouput file.

Step 10:After going through the Confusion Matrix I was getting Good Result.
